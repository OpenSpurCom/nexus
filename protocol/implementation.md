Everything is a plugin

Software is composed out of plugins with clear API.
Plugins can be written by one person, one team or several teams.
Every contribution to the git repository is evaluated by ACE as a percentage of all other contributions.

Plugins can delegate parts of the work to other plugins even if such plugins do not yet exist.
This is called a request-for-implementation.
Big ideas break down recursively into ever smaller ideas, fueled by investor support.

Plugins have associated per-run execution costs determined automatically.
A software made up of a collection of plugins has a per-run execution cost.

Plugins can be bought or sold in the innovation marketplace.
When ownership is transfered, the new owner gets funds derived from all its execution.

A plugin repository stores plugins and the following metadata about each plugin:

1. The git repo(public or private)
2. Hash of callable functions(common to all interchangeable plugins)
3. Callable functions and the arity and type of parameters
4. The compiled wasm
5. Hash of modules called(and git repo)

Plugins can only run on vetted VPSs and clouds(especially when private plugins are involved).

Plugins can be written in the following programming languages.

Here is how you can make your favorite programming language compatible with OpenSpur.
The compatibility module is... a module, so you stand to profit from implementing it.

The trust layer is built on a custom tendermint blockchain.
The token ticker is SPUR on all major blockchain platforms.

With the SPUR token you can:

a. register a module in the repository
a. pay for deploying and running modules
b. buy module ownership

SPUR can be obtain by:

a. Direct BTC payment here
b. Burning our custom tokens on Ethereum, BNB and Solana
c. Buying it with a bank transfer or credit card

The default versioning system is git.
Inside a module, this is how contributions are automatically evaluated.

The initial tasks were to:

a. set the minimum necesary preconditions for this whole ecosystem to flourish(system design + behaviour)
b. explain it using the least amount of words(minimize the energy needed to adoption)
c. incentivize key player adoption

The following tasks are to chase the infinite horizon of knowledge and possibility.
