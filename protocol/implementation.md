# Everything is a plugin  

This repo is a plugin that runs on the blockchain and the entry point of the OpenSpur system.<br>
It will include the source code that can be executed and a list of dependent modules it relies on for said execution.<br>   

Software is composed out of plugins with clear API.<br>  
Plugins can be written by one person, one team or several teams.<br>   
Every contribution to the git repository is evaluated by ACE as a percentage of all other contributions.<br>  

Plugins can delegate parts of the work to other plugins even if such plugins do not yet exist.<br>  
This is called a request-for-implementation.<br>  
Big ideas break down recursively into ever smaller ideas, fueled by investor support.<br>  

Plugins have associated per-run execution costs determined automatically.<br>  
A software made up of a collection of plugins has a per-run execution cost.<br>  

Plugins can be bought or sold in the innovation marketplace.<br>  
When ownership is transfered, the new owner gets funds derived from all its execution.<br>  

A plugin repository stores plugins and the following metadata about each plugin:<br>  

1. The git repo(public or private)<br>  
2. Hash of callable functions(common to all interchangeable plugins)<br>  
3. Callable functions and the arity and type of parameters<br>  
4. The compiled wasm<br>  
5. Hash of modules called(and git repo)<br>  

Plugins can be public or private.<br>
Private plugins can only run on vetted VPSs and clouds to protect the IP of the author.<br>  

Plugins can be written in the following programming languages:<br>
- JavaScript / TypeScript (Node, Deno, Bun, browser)<br>
- Rust<br>
- Go<br>
- Python<br>
- Ruby<br>
- PHP<br>
- Java<br>
- .NET (C#, F#)<br>
- C<br>
- C++<br>
- Zig<br>
- OCaml<br>
- Elixir<br>
- Haskell<br>
- Perl<br>

Here is how you can make your favorite programming language compatible with OpenSpur.<br>  
The compatibility module is... a module, so you stand to profit from implementing it.<br>  

The trust layer is built on a custom tendermint blockchain.<br>  
The token ticker is SPUR on all major blockchain platforms.<br>  

With the SPUR token you can:<br>  

a. register a module in the repository<br>  
a. pay for deploying and running modules<br>  
b. buy module ownership<br>  

SPUR can be obtain by:<br>  

a. Direct BTC payment<br>  
b. Burning our custom tokens on Ethereum, BNB and Solana<br>  
c. Buying it with a bank transfer or credit card<br>  

The default versioning system is git.<br>  
Inside a module, this is how contributions are automatically evaluated.<br>  

The initial tasks were to:<br>  

a. set the minimum necesary preconditions for this whole ecosystem to flourish(system design + behaviour)<br>  
b. explain it using the least amount of words(minimize the energy needed to adoption)<br>  
c. incentivize key player adoption<br>  

The following tasks are to chase the infinite horizon of knowledge and possibility.
