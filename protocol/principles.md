# Principles

Let's look at a high level view of the system.
First, WHY we need OpenSpur.
Then, what incentives are given and what structure was chosen to make 

No matter the tools we build, the human mind will reign supreme.

Imagine that benevolent extraterrestrials land on Earth and leave us a black-box device. 
The box will answer, with unfailing accuracy, any yes-or-no question about the outcome of a physically possible experiment.
Crucially, the box never explains why the answer is yes or no; it simply flashes one of two lights.

Each yes/no reply yields one bit.
To specify a modest engineering blueprint containing, say, 10 MB of information, you would need 80 million structured queries – and you would have to know the exact sequence of questions in advance.
Without an explanatory theory of aerodynamics, materials science, control systems, etc., you would have no clue which 80 million questions to ask – a combinatorial explosion that makes the oracle effectively useless for invention.

It is indeed true that modern systems provide more than yes/no questions.
However, the argument still stands.

Data guides us only AFTER we have a conjectured model and a critical test in mind.
And to have a conjectured model we must have deep understanding of the constituents of the said model - and the constituents of constituents, and so forth.

Moreover.
The entropy of the 1st phrase describing a novel system hugely reduces its entropy. 
Out of nothing, it has isolated a very narrow, plausible world-view.
This is something that will be impossible for machines to do for a very long time.

This is a task fit for the human mind - which, dare we say, may be quantum in nature - and a mesh of human minds working together.
Even if automated reasoning advances, WHAT to explore will be hard for current machines to decide(and this needs to be done recursively).

1. Trust(ACE methodology)

Innovation is a series of composable aha-moments. 
The aha-moments come from having very good explanations for the inner workings of the system.
Since the aha-moments come from different people, we must be fair with the energy distribution - so that we further incentivize innovation.
Any other system is not energy efficient because it necesarily doubles(or triples, quadruples etc) work others have done.
In order for the participants to agree to generate knowledge together they must have a layer of trust, given by the system's fairness.
This is why evaluating every contribution towards a given goal fairly and transparently is foundational to the system and a cross-cutting component of it.
Each time the intellectual property is used - be it novel knowledge for building new energy sources, source code or something else - dividends are payed out to the contributors.

Source code can run anywhere - for example, as part of OpenSpur's blockchain, on a dedicated machine or in the cloud.
For source code, all bundled contributions are automatically and fairly priced. 
On each execution of the source code, all contributors are paid their fair share for that contribution.

Hence the name: Automated Contribution Evaluation.

This is a private module. 
You can see some examples of it being run here(on source code with explanatory readmes) and here(pure knowledge).

2. Interoperability and recursion(modules)

Dreaming about 

As knowledge deepens, previous explanations become futile. 
So we need to replace, reconsider or update components of the system.

Swappable modules are the building block of OpenSpur.
A module can have multiple contributors. 
Each contribution is evaluated automatically as the energy necessary to have built it.
Since OpenSpur is a collection of OpenSpur modules, this evaluation module can be improved upon and swapped as can any others.

Modules can be written in any programming language and have clear APIs and a hash address.
This hash address can be used to propose a new, better module for the given task.
The module then becomes a part of the repository of modules and can be deployed as part of working software.
Public modules have the ability to levrage private modules, thus increasing the chance of getting better by crowdsourcing fairly remunerated contributions.

Investors can further evaluate the value of a module by betting on its future price or by making an aquisition offer.
Modules become a proportion of each system they are plugged into.

Security is easily breached when running code you download from the internet. 
Modules require permission and are automatically audited.

3. Network effects

Levraging highly specialized knowledge from people deeply interested in solving the problem minimizes the global energy needed to solve a problem.
It also puts the system in a Nash equilibrium.

Mechanics that minimize the energy needed to identify or call upon new thinkers and builders exist in an incipient phase.
You are welcome to contribute.
Either improve or think about new systems to do this.
And get your share of OpenSpur, the new home of minds!

Therefore, in order to 

i.   maximize societal output 
ii.  minimize misery(most jobs are bullshit)
iii. let each human soar to the highest level of their creative force 

we need to be able to reward properly every contribution towards innovation - with a fraction of the energy saved thanks to their work(or energy spent).

To recap, OpenSpur is a system that is

i.  fair, transparent - reward everyody that defines missions(visionaries) or contributes towards it
ii. interoperable - let modules have clear APIs and be swappable
ii. permisionless - accept contributions from everybody. Build tools to make it easy to do so.

And we need to do this with the least amount of rules possible - so that it's easy to understand(minimize adoption energy) and contribute to and hard to corrupt.

Axiomatically, these rules are rooted in truth, transparency and permisionlessness.
We aim to find the minimal set of rules for distributing energy(resources) and levraging information so that a diversity of human endeavours is harmonized. 

Next, we'll be looking at a working implementation of OpenSpur.
But this is far from over - and it never will be.
The games have just begun!
