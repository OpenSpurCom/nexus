# Principles

Let's look at a high level view of the system.<br>  
First, WHY we need OpenSpur.<br>  
Then, what incentives are given and what structure was chosen to grow the economy flywheel of the ecosystem.<br>  

No matter the tools we build, the human mind will reign supreme.<br>  

Imagine that benevolent extraterrestrials land on Earth and leave us a black-box device.<br>   
The box will answer, with unfailing accuracy, any yes-or-no question about the outcome of a physically possible experiment.<br>  
Crucially, the box never explains why the answer is yes or no; it simply flashes one of two lights.<br>  

Each yes/no reply yields one bit.<br>  
To specify a modest engineering blueprint containing, say, 10 MB of information, you would need 80 million structured queries – and you would have to know the exact sequence of questions in advance.<br>  
Without an explanatory theory of aerodynamics, materials science, control systems, etc., you would have no clue which 80 million questions to ask – a combinatorial explosion that makes the oracle effectively useless for invention.<br>  

It is indeed true that modern systems provide more than yes/no questions.<br>  
However, the argument still stands.<br>  

Data guides us only AFTER we have a conjectured model and a critical test in mind.<br>  
And to have a conjectured model we must have deep understanding of the constituents of the said model - and the constituents of constituents, and so forth.<br>  

Moreover.<br>  
The information increase of the first phrase describing a novel system hugely reduces the informational entropy. <br>   
Out of nothing, it has isolated a very narrow, plausible world-view.<br>  
This is something that will be impossible for machines to do for a very long time.<br>  

This is a task fit for the human mind - which, dare we say, may be quantum in nature - and a mesh of human minds working together.<br>  
Even if automated reasoning advances, WHAT to explore will be hard for current machines to decide(and this needs to be done recursively).<br>  

1. Trust(ACE methodology)<br>  

Innovation is a series of composable aha-moments.<br>   
The aha-moments come from having very good explanations for the inner workings of the system.<br>  
Since the aha-moments come from different people, we must be fair with the energy distribution - so that we further incentivize innovation.<br>  
Any other system is not energy efficient because it necesarily doubles(or triples, quadruples etc) work others have done.<br>  
In order for the participants to agree to generate knowledge together they must have a layer of trust, given by the system's fairness.<br>  
This is why evaluating every contribution towards a given goal fairly and transparently is foundational to the system and a cross-cutting component of it.<br>  
Each time the intellectual property is used - be it novel knowledge for building new energy sources, source code or something else - dividends are payed out to the contributors.<br>  

Source code can run anywhere - for example, as part of OpenSpur's blockchain, on a dedicated machine or in the cloud.<br>  
For source code, all bundled contributions are automatically and fairly priced.<br>  
On each execution of the source code, all contributors are paid their fair share for that contribution.<br>  

Hence the name: Automated Contribution Evaluation.<br>  

2. Interoperability and recursion(modules)<br>  

Dreaming about<br>  

As knowledge deepens, previous explanations become futile.<br>   
So we need to replace, reconsider or update components of the system.<br>  

Swappable modules are the building block of OpenSpur.<br>  
A module can have multiple contributors.<br>  
Each contribution is evaluated automatically as the energy necessary to have built it.<br>  
Since OpenSpur is a collection of OpenSpur modules, this evaluation module can be improved upon and swapped as can any others.<br>  

Modules can be written in any programming language and have clear APIs and a hash address.<br>  
This hash address can be used to propose a new, better module for the given task.<br>  
The module then becomes a part of the repository of modules and can be deployed as part of working software.<br>  
Public modules have the ability to levrage private modules, thus increasing the chance of getting better by crowdsourcing fairly remunerated contributions.<br>  

Investors can further evaluate the value of a module by betting on its future price or by making an aquisition offer.<br>  
Modules become a proportion of each system they are plugged into.<br>  

Security is easily breached when running code you download from the internet.<br>   
Modules require permission and are automatically audited.<br>  

3. Network effects<br>  

Levraging highly specialized knowledge from people deeply interested in solving the problem minimizes the global energy needed to solve a problem.<br>  
It also puts the system in a Nash equilibrium.<br>  

Mechanics that minimize the energy needed to identify or call upon new thinkers and builders exist in an incipient phase.<br>  
You are welcome to contribute.<br>  
Either improve or think about new systems to do this.<br>  
And get your share of OpenSpur, the new home of minds!<br>  

Therefore, in order to<br>  

i.   maximize societal output<br>   
ii.  minimize misery(most jobs are bullshit)<br>  
iii. let each human soar to the highest level of their creative force<br>   

we need to be able to reward properly every contribution towards innovation - with a fraction of the energy saved thanks to their work(or energy spent).<br>  

To recap, OpenSpur is a system that is<br>  

i.  fair, transparent - reward everyody that defines missions(visionaries) or contributes towards it<br>  
ii. interoperable - let modules have clear APIs and be swappable<br>  
ii. permisionless - accept contributions from everybody. Build tools to make it easy to do so.<br>  

And we need to do this with the least amount of rules possible - so that it's easy to understand(minimize adoption energy) and contribute to and hard to corrupt.<br>  

Axiomatically, these rules are rooted in truth, transparency and permisionlessness.<br>  
We aim to find the minimal set of rules for distributing energy(resources) and levraging information so that a diversity of human endeavours is harmonized.<br>   

Next, we'll be looking at a working implementation of OpenSpur.<br>  
But this is far from over - and it never will be.<br>  
The games have just begun!
