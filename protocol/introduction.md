Energy efficiency is the single most important emergence factor of reality - and a good explanation for everything we see around us.

Atoms form molecules. 
Molecules form cells.
Cells form organs.
Organs form individuals.

All in the name of energy minimization. 
The fiber of reality is built with simple rules, applied recursively from highly composable elements.

Innovation, although not tangible, reduces energy use for humans. 
A wheel reduces friction so you use less force when pushing a cart. 

If your history teacher made you read this - we used to lack an energy efficient mechanism at the societal level. 
We used to call this lack of energy efficiency corruption.
This is how we got rid off it.

Bitcoin invented verifiable cryptographic scarcity but its actual implicit goal was a meritocratic distribution of resources. 
This is that distribution mechanism.

It's based on things that matter - contributions towards innovative tools and processes.
And the mechanism to failry remunerate each participant.

There is much more to write on this topic and the reasons behind building OpenSpur.

From the foundational concepts of emergence, synergy and the encompasing reductionism world view.

On to recursively breaking down big missions into actionable roadmaps, using crowdsourced, fairly remunerated knowledge.

On levraging at every step an ever-increasing mesh of experts such that the energy required to solve the tasks is minimized.
And on building the tools to identify the best expert at the right time using our 700 million experts database.

Which finally gets down to the implementation details of interoperable, swappable modules so we reach a point of Nash equilibrium. 

The horizon of human knowledge is infinite and we're obliged to chase it.
Let's do it with love, in truth and with grace!
