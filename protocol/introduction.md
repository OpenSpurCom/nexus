Energy efficiency is the single most important emergence factor of reality - and a good explanation for everything we see around us.<br>  

Atoms form molecules.<br>  
Molecules form cells.<br>  
Cells form organs.<br>  
Organs form individuals.<br>  

All in the name of energy minimization.<br>   
The fiber of reality is built with simple rules, applied recursively from highly composable elements.<br>  

Innovation, although not tangible, reduces energy use for humans.<br>  
A wheel reduces friction so you use less force when pushing a cart.<br>   

If your history teacher made you read this - we used to lack an energy efficient mechanism at the societal level.<br>   
We used to call this lack of energy efficiency corruption.<br>  
This is how we got rid off it.<br>  

Bitcoin invented verifiable cryptographic scarcity but its actual implicit goal was a meritocratic distribution of resources.<br>   
This is that distribution mechanism.<br>  

It's based on things that matter - contributions towards innovative tools and processes.<br>  
And the mechanism to failry remunerate each participant.<br>  

There is much more to write on this topic and the reasons behind building OpenSpur.<br>  

From the foundational concepts of emergence, synergy and the encompasing reductionism world view.<br>  

On to recursively breaking down big missions into actionable roadmaps, using crowdsourced, fairly remunerated knowledge.<br>  

On levraging at every step an ever-increasing mesh of experts such that the energy required to solve the tasks is minimized.<br>  
And on building the tools to identify and automatically contact the best expert at the right time using our 700 million experts database.<br>  

Which finally gets down to the implementation details of interoperable, swappable modules so we reach a point of Nash equilibrium.<br>   

The horizon of human knowledge is infinite and we're obliged to chase it.<br>  
Let's do it with love, in truth and with grace!
