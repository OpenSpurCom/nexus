# OpenSpur: A Fair Innovation Ecosystem

## The First Question

There are many problems in need of viable solutions.
The reason they are not being solved is the lack of clear, transparent incentives to solve them.

It's not just the lack of clear incentives.
Complex problems are multidisciplinary.
There is no trust layer for problem solvers to work together.

If problems are multidisciplinary - the solution is built from modules.
There is no technology that makes these modules interoperable.
Software, for instance, could be made better by optimizing its constituents.

The distribution mechanism is broken - an innovation saving users 20 cents monthly will have no distribution channel.
It's very expensive to build the operations around it.
It's very expensive to aquire customers. 
Even when it could impact one billion people, bringing the total value to hundreds of millions.
The innovation would have to be sold to companies. Selling has nothing to do with building.
Most companies are 90% operations and 10% actual problem-solving - the thing you care about when you buy the product.

Compounding laws apply.
So chaining 4 or 5 20 cent innovations might add up to 10 dollars of savings per unit, yearly.

Most problem-solvers are eager to do good and grow intellectualy by solving hard problems.
But because of all of the above, they usually end up playing office politics.
Or open-sourcing their solutions and getting no payment which diminishes the appetite to do so in the future.

Sic transit gloria mundi. 
We've devised a protocol crowdfunding and crowdsourcing generative H.I.(Human-Intelligence).
Can we change this so that we capture the full value humans are able to produce?

## Introduction: Energy Efficiency as the Foundation of Reality

Energy efficiency is the single most important emergence factor of reality - and a good explanation for everything we see around us.

* Atoms form molecules.
* Molecules form cells.
* Cells form organs.
* Organs form individuals.

All in the name of energy minimization. The fiber of reality is built with simple rules, applied recursively from highly composable elements.

Innovation, although not tangible, reduces energy use for humans. 
A wheel reduces friction so you use less force when pushing a cart. 
If your history teacher made you read this - we used to lack an energy efficient mechanism at the societal level. 
We used to call this lack of energy efficiency corruption. 
This is how we got rid of it.

Bitcoin invented verifiable cryptographic scarcity but its actual implicit goal was a meritocratic distribution of resources. 
OpenSpur is that distribution mechanism. 
It's based on things that matter - contributions towards innovative tools and processes. 
And the mechanism to fairly remunerate each participant.

## The OpenSpur solution: Innovation's Missing Attribution Layer

Explanations are of paramount importance. 
Good explanations correctly identify the components that participate in the emergence of the system. 
A system that can swap these components with better ones will improve constantly and polynomially.

Coming up with entirely new explanations and set of components fundamentally changes the game.
A system that can change the structure with a better one will improve exponentially. 

Just like a living organism - composing simple building blocks creates synergy and emergence.
Free contributors will choose tasks that naturally minimize their energy given their skills.
This will impose a global optimum - a nash equilibrium.

Contributors will earn as much as possible given their skills while doing what they love.
Problems will be sorted by importance by putting a number on them and solved with least energy possible.

Minimizing the energy needed to run the Linux kernel by 10% would translate to an energy bill cut of 3.3 billion anually.
We are currently piloting this use case for OpenSpur with a handful of kernel core contributors.

Collaboration is key - if we are to deploy the skills where they're mostly needed.
Problems and sub-problems will be solved by those that minimize the time and energy needed to do so 

Truth is the foundation we base this on.
Trust follows, so contributors can collaborate.

Fair, transparent, perpetual rewards for the problems solved is central to this model.
And a fair percentage allocation for contributors working towards the goal.
Be it finding new quantifiable problems to solve, envisioning new ways of solving the problems or solving very specific ones.

Research and imagination is the tool used by those finding new problems to solve.
Delegation is the tool for people finding new ways of doing things. 
It creates blank modules that fit together to solve the problem in novel ways with the understanding that other contributors will do it.
This will create a living ecosystem around a great idea, making it a viable reality.

Problem solvers will find hard technical challenges to solve and be paid proportional to the information density of their solution.
It's in their interest to keep this minimal - or it will be ripe for disruption as modules are interchangeable.
Think of this as a micro-SaaS and the basic unit the system builds on.

We present a modular framework that works with swappable plugins with clear APIs.
To improve composability, modules or plugins can be written in any programming language.
It works with the current build tools and offers cryptographic guarantees of payment to the contributors.

We will only solve problems with clear price tags.
This will be computed automatically, as will pricing all software modules produced.
Incidentally, this gives users a one credit system to access all built software.

## Technical solution

Ideas precede implementations.
We remunerate failry everything - from the very first phrase outlining the solution to the actual implementation.

Everything is a module. And behind every module, there is an idea.
Modules are composed into working software that users pay to run.

The price is determined as a fraction of the problem solved - usually 15% or the amount of energy saved for the user.

Each module gets a number - the energy density of the solution.
And every contributor, through their contribution, gets a percentage proportional to this energy density measure.

The user is billed per time unit.
When funds flow into the system, the system immediatelly distributes the funds to the contributors.

The protocol follows the same rules - it's a collection of modules.
You will find a list of modules that compose OpenSpur later this week.

This is a wrapper built on top of existing tools and methodologies, making OpenSpur compatible with the current technologies for building, shipping and deploying software.
There are no tools to learn or build - thus minimizing adoption energy.

The system is permisionless - anyone can submit a PR or start a new OpenSpur module that others will use and contribute to.

We have implemented a custom Tendermint blockchain to implement this system.

We have also setup burn and mint gateways.
[The ethereum gateway to SPUR is live on Uniswap.](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xa28c8437cd3a978292b5ffEcDC9E6479B82b0ecb&chain=mainnet)

As we are finalizing the last tests, we are getting ready to release OpenSpur.  
Meanwhile, if we've pinged you, we want you a part of it.  
Star this repo and stand at the ready!
