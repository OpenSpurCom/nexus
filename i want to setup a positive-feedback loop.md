i want to setup a positive-feedback loop and a new viable economic model

the system has 3 actors:

innovators - build products that users use because it saves users energy in a quantifiable way
users - buyers of the product. 
investors - people that evaluate the total value being produced and that buy innovators' work 
innovations - the product. delivered as software and paid for on each execution.

Innovators can work together on innovations. I have a magic oracle that splits the percentages to innovators each time the software is paid for and ran.

The system/underlying financial protocol is also an innovation users pay for when they use it to request to run the innovation.

So we can auto price the innovation fairly and fairly distribute each payment to the innovators on each run.

1. what should we charge the economic entity we're automating the work for?
2. how can we fit this into the software cartridge model, where they pay on each execution? should we have a translator for cloud services, where if users pay them on a per-hour basis we do the same? 


[] that users use to pay for innovative products because it saves them energy in a quantifiable manner. 

 

let's say that we come up with an innovation worth 300 billion yearly in slashed energy costs for a cloud provider. what should we charge the cloud provider?
