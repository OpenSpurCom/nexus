# The first question

You sit bolt upright at 3AM, heart racing.<br>
The equation fusion scientists have been looking for is staring back at you.<br>

As reality sets in, euphoria fades.<br>
There is no way to monetize this. Not for you.<br>

The absurdity crushes you.<br>
Dozens of well-funded fusion companies exist.<br>
All the legal and operational set up.<br>

They're looking for what you've discovered.<br>

Yet you'd need to build an organization from scratch to capture any value.<br>
Deep thinkers are not operators.<br>
Pure energy waste in a system supposedly optimizing for efficiency.<br>

If only there existed a mechanism to fairly compensate breakthrough insights.<br>
One that could fairly evaluate your contribution.<br>
Where you could swap your breakthrough for their open questions(and stock).<br>

What's more, your equation has two gaps.<br>

It requires a novel superconducting material you can't develop.<br>
The one person you know who has solved this lives on another continent, unreachable, with no reason to help you.<br>

It also needs quantum simulations beyond your expertise.<br>
Handful of people globally can validate your work.<br>
But they are locked behind institutional walls, inaccessible.<br>
Even if found, they have the same problem as you.<br>
How would you trust each other and why would they invest energy into it?<br>

You dread the missing connective tissue between brilliant minds.<br>
It wastes as much potential as the gap between insight and implementation.<br>

You close your notebook. It was an amazing ride.<br>
Another breakthrough trapped in potential, never to be kinetic.<br>

How many more innovative ideas are trapped out there, spread across computer science, applied artificial intelligence or medicine?<br>
And how many brilliant people play office politics while sitting on world-changing ideas, knowing full well what we all know but never articulate?<br>

The current status quo is bullshit.
