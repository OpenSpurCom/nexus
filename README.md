# The first question

You sit bolt upright at 3AM, heart racing. 
The equation fusion scientists have been looking for is staring back at you.

As reality sets in, euphoria fades.
There is no way to monetize this. Not for you.

The absurdity crushes you. 
Dozens of well-funded fusion companies exist.
All the legal and operational set up. 

They're looking for what you've discovered.

Yet you'd need to build an organization from scratch to capture any value. 
Deep thinkers are not operators.
Pure energy waste in a system supposedly optimizing for efficiency.

If only there existed a mechanism to fairly compensate breakthrough insights.
One that could fairly evaluate your contribution.
Where you could swap your breakthrough for their open questions(and stock).

What's more, your equation has two gaps. 

It requires a novel superconducting material you can't develop. 
The one person you know who has solved this lives on another continent, unreachable, with no reason to help you.

It also needs quantum simulations beyond your expertise. 
Handful of people globally can validate your work.
But they are locked behind institutional walls, inaccessible. 
Even if found, they have the same problem as you.
How would you trust each other and why would they invest energy into it?

You dread the missing connective tissue between brilliant minds.
It wastes as much potential as the gap between insight and implementation.

You close your notebook. It was an amazing ride.
Another breakthrough trapped in potential, never to be kinetic.

How many more innovative ideas are trapped out there, spread across computer science, applied artificial intelligence or medicine? 
And how many brilliant people play office politics while sitting on world-changing ideas, knowing full well what we all know but never articulate?

The current status quo is bullshit.
