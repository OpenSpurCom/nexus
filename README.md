# OpenSpur: A Fair Innovation Ecosystem

## The First Question

You sit bolt upright at 3AM, heart racing.
The equation fusion scientists have been looking for is staring back at you.

As reality sets in, euphoria fades.
There is no way to monetize this. Not for you.

The absurdity crushes you.
Dozens of well-funded fusion companies exist.
All the legal and operational set up.

They're looking for what you've discovered.

Yet you'd need to build an organization from scratch to capture any value.
Deep thinkers are not operators.
Pure energy waste in a system supposedly optimizing for efficiency.

If only there existed a mechanism to fairly compensate breakthrough insights.
One that could fairly evaluate your contribution.
Where you could swap your breakthrough for their open questions(and stock).

What's more, your equation has two gaps.

It requires a novel superconducting material you can't develop.
The one person you know who has solved this lives on another continent, unreachable, with no reason to help you.

It also needs quantum simulations beyond your expertise.
Handful of people globally can validate your work.
But they are locked behind institutional walls, inaccessible.
Even if found, they have the same problem as you.
How would you trust each other and why would they invest energy into it?

You dread the missing connective tissue between brilliant minds.
It wastes as much potential as the gap between insight and implementation.

You close your notebook. It was an amazing ride.
Another breakthrough trapped in potential, never to be kinetic.

How many more innovative ideas are trapped out there, spread across computer science, applied artificial intelligence or medicine?
And how many brilliant people play office politics while sitting on world-changing ideas, knowing full well what we all know but never articulate?

The current status quo is bullshit.

## Introduction: Energy Efficiency as the Foundation of Reality

Energy efficiency is the single most important emergence factor of reality - and a good explanation for everything we see around us.

* Atoms form molecules.
* Molecules form cells.
* Cells form organs.
* Organs form individuals.

All in the name of energy minimization. The fiber of reality is built with simple rules, applied recursively from highly composable elements.

Innovation, although not tangible, reduces energy use for humans. A wheel reduces friction so you use less force when pushing a cart. If your history teacher made you read this - we used to lack an energy efficient mechanism at the societal level. We used to call this lack of energy efficiency corruption. This is how we got rid of it.

Bitcoin invented verifiable cryptographic scarcity but its actual implicit goal was a meritocratic distribution of resources. OpenSpur is that distribution mechanism. It's based on things that matter - contributions towards innovative tools and processes. And the mechanism to fairly remunerate each participant.

## The Problem: Innovation's Missing Attribution Layer

No matter the tools we build, the human mind will reign supreme.

Imagine that benevolent extraterrestrials land on Earth and leave us a black-box device. The box will answer, with unfailing accuracy, any yes-or-no question about the outcome of a physically possible experiment. Crucially, the box never explains why the answer is yes or no; it simply flashes one of two lights.

Each yes/no reply yields one bit. To specify a modest engineering blueprint containing, say, 10 MB of information, you would need 80 million structured queries – and you would have to know the exact sequence of questions in advance. Without an explanatory theory of aerodynamics, materials science, control systems, etc., you would have no clue which 80 million questions to ask – a combinatorial explosion that makes the oracle effectively useless for invention.

It is indeed true that modern systems provide more than yes/no questions. However, the argument still stands.

Data guides us only AFTER we have a conjectured model and a critical test in mind. And to have a conjectured model we must have deep understanding of the constituents of the said model - and the constituents of constituents, and so forth.

Moreover. The information increase of the first phrase describing a novel system hugely reduces the informational entropy. Out of nothing, it has isolated a very narrow, plausible world-view. This is something that will be impossible for machines to do for a very long time.

This is a task fit for the human mind - which, dare we say, may be quantum in nature - and a mesh of human minds working together. Even if automated reasoning advances, WHAT to explore will be hard for current machines to decide (and this needs to be done recursively).

## The OpenSpur Solution: Three Core Principles

### 1. Trust (ACE Methodology)

Innovation is a series of composable aha-moments. The aha-moments come from having very good explanations for the inner workings of the system. Since the aha-moments come from different people, we must be fair with the energy distribution - so that we further incentivize innovation.

Any other system is not energy efficient because it necessarily doubles (or triples, quadruples etc) work others have done. In order for the participants to agree to generate knowledge together they must have a layer of trust, given by the system's fairness.

This is why evaluating every contribution towards a given goal fairly and transparently is foundational to the system and a cross-cutting component of it. Each time the intellectual property is used - be it novel knowledge for building new energy sources, source code or something else - dividends are paid out to the contributors.

Source code can run anywhere - for example, as part of OpenSpur's blockchain, on a dedicated machine or in the cloud. For source code, all bundled contributions are automatically and fairly priced. On each execution of the source code, all contributors are paid their fair share for that contribution.

Hence the name: Automated Contribution Evaluation (ACE).

### 2. Interoperability and Recursion (Modules)

As knowledge deepens, previous explanations become futile. So we need to replace, reconsider or update components of the system.

Swappable modules are the building block of OpenSpur. A module can have multiple contributors. Each contribution is evaluated automatically as the energy necessary to have built it. Since OpenSpur is a collection of OpenSpur modules, this evaluation module can be improved upon and swapped as can any others.

Modules can be written in any programming language and have clear APIs and a hash address. This hash address can be used to propose a new, better module for the given task. The module then becomes a part of the repository of modules and can be deployed as part of working software.

Public modules have the ability to leverage private modules, thus increasing the chance of getting better by crowdsourcing fairly remunerated contributions.

Investors can further evaluate the value of a module by betting on its future price or by making an acquisition offer. Modules become a proportion of each system they are plugged into.

Security is easily breached when running code you download from the internet. Modules require permission and are automatically audited.

### 3. Network Effects

Leveraging highly specialized knowledge from people deeply interested in solving the problem minimizes the global energy needed to solve a problem. It also puts the system in a Nash equilibrium.

Mechanics that minimize the energy needed to identify or call upon new thinkers and builders exist in an incipient phase. You are welcome to contribute. Either improve or think about new systems to do this. And get your share of OpenSpur, the new home of minds!

## Implementation: Everything is a Plugin

This repo is a plugin that runs on the blockchain and the entry point of the OpenSpur system. It will include the source code that can be executed and a list of dependent modules it relies on for said execution.

Software is composed out of plugins with clear API. Plugins can be written by one person, one team or several teams. Every contribution to the git repository is evaluated by ACE as a percentage of all other contributions.

Plugins can delegate parts of the work to other plugins even if such plugins do not yet exist. This is called a request-for-implementation. Big ideas break down recursively into ever smaller ideas, fueled by investor support.

Plugins have associated per-run execution costs determined automatically. A software made up of a collection of plugins has a per-run execution cost.

Plugins can be bought or sold in the innovation marketplace. When ownership is transferred, the new owner gets funds derived from all its execution.

A plugin repository stores plugins and the following metadata about each plugin:

1. The git repo (public or private)
2. Hash of callable functions (common to all interchangeable plugins)
3. Callable functions and the arity and type of parameters
4. The compiled wasm
5. Hash of modules called (and git repo)

Plugins can be public or private. Private plugins can only run on vetted VPSs and clouds to protect the IP of the author.

### Technical Implementation

Plugins can be written in the following programming languages:
- JavaScript / TypeScript (Node, Deno, Bun, browser)
- Rust
- Go
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
- Java
- .NET (C#, F#)
- C
- C++
- Zig
- OCaml
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Perl

Here is how you can make your favorite programming language compatible with OpenSpur. The compatibility module is... a module, so you stand to profit from implementing it.

The trust layer is built on a custom tendermint blockchain. The token ticker is SPUR on all major blockchain platforms.

With the SPUR token you can:
1. Register a module in the repository
2. Pay for deploying and running modules
3. Buy module ownership

SPUR can be obtained by:
1. Direct BTC payment
2. Burning our custom tokens on Ethereum, BNB and Solana
3. Buying it with a bank transfer or credit card

The default versioning system is git. Inside a module, this is how contributions are automatically evaluated.

## Vision and Future

Therefore, in order to:

1. Maximize societal output
2. Minimize misery (most jobs are bullshit)
3. Let each human soar to the highest level of their creative force

We need to be able to reward properly every contribution towards innovation - with a fraction of the energy saved thanks to their work (or energy spent).

To recap, OpenSpur is a system that is:

1. Fair, transparent - reward everybody that defines missions (visionaries) or contributes towards them
2. Interoperable - let modules have clear APIs and be swappable
3. Permissionless - accept contributions from everybody. Build tools to make it easy to do so.

And we need to do this with the least amount of rules possible - so that it's easy to understand (minimize adoption energy) and contribute to and hard to corrupt.

Axiomatically, these rules are rooted in truth, transparency and permissionlessness. We aim to find the minimal set of rules for distributing energy (resources) and leveraging information so that a diversity of human endeavors is harmonized.

There is much more to write on this topic and the reasons behind building OpenSpur. From the foundational concepts of emergence, synergy and the encompassing reductionism world view. On to recursively breaking down big missions into actionable roadmaps, using crowdsourced, fairly remunerated knowledge. On leveraging at every step an ever-increasing mesh of experts such that the energy required to solve the tasks is minimized. And on building the tools to identify and automatically contact the best expert at the right time using our 700 million experts database.

Which finally gets down to the implementation details of interoperable, swappable modules so we reach a point of Nash equilibrium.

The horizon of human knowledge is infinite and we're obliged to chase it. Let's do it with love, in truth and with grace!

---

The initial tasks were to:
1. Set the minimum necessary preconditions for this whole ecosystem to flourish (system design + behavior)
2. Explain it using the least amount of words (minimize the energy needed for adoption)
3. Incentivize key player adoption

The following tasks are to chase the infinite horizon of knowledge and possibility.

The games have just begun!
