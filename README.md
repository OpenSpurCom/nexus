## OpenSpur: A Fair Innovation Ecosystem

### 1 ¬∑ The Problem

Many critical problems remain unsolved due to a lack of clear, transparent incentives. Complex challenges are inherently multidisciplinary, yet there is no trust framework that allows diverse problem-solvers to collaborate seamlessly.

- **Problem discovery is ad hoc.** We lack a systematic way to identify and rank problems by potential impact:
  - Quantum decoherence, for example, could unlock $2.1 trillion in value‚Äîbut demands mathematicians, physicists, and chemists working together.
  - Even small wins (e.g. novel video compression saving $0.20/month per user) compound into huge annual savings for large services.
- **Yo-yo problem**  A group of experts may outline a breakthrough, but every step depends on modules that don‚Äôt yet exist, forcing them to bounce between big-picture vision and missing pieces until momentum is lost.
- **Attribution is broken**: When 10 people contribute to a solution, who gets paid what?
- **Coordination is hard**: Complex problems need multiple specialists, but no trust layer connects them
- **Skill matching is inefficient.** The perfect specialist may exist‚Äîbut there‚Äôs no seamless path to match them with the right work. 
- **Distribution is expensive**: A 20-cent monthly saving per user needs massive marketing and operational budget. Realistically, companies need to buy the innovation and sales have nothing to do with building. This is because users buy in bulk - they buy Netflix, not better, cheaper to stream video compression.
- **Public‚Äìprivate split is painful.** Current tooling is all-or-nothing: you can publish an open plugin spec or keep the whole repo private, but you can‚Äôt combine the two. That forces teams to choose between building in public or protecting IP‚Äîslowing collaboration.

As a result, talented problem-solvers get stuck in office politics or open-source valuable solutions without compensation, diminishing long-term motivation. Hard problems people would love to work on become impossible, when in fact they should be solved.

### 2 ¬∑ Energy Efficiency as a Foundation

Emergent systems‚Äîfrom atoms forming molecules to molecules forming organisms‚Äîowe their existance to the rule of energy minimization. Innovation operates the same way. A wheel reduces friction, saving muscular effort, minimizing the energy needed to move objects.  

Bitcoin introduced verifiable scarcity aiming to distribute resources meritocratically, which failed. 
OpenSpur distributes resources meritocratically by transparentizing rewards attached to solving problems and rewarding all problem-solvers involved fairly - with cryptographic guarantees attached.
There is one function applied recursively that brings stakeholders into synergy and makes our system emerge - automatic contribution evaluation. It works surprisingly well across sectors and domains of knowledge, from evaluating ideas, on to code and mechanical design.

### 3 ¬∑ Our Vision

OpenSpur is a protocol to crowdfund and crowdsource Human Intelligence (H.I.), capturing the full value generated by contributors through:

- **Repository of problems with transparent rewards.** Systematically identify and rank challenges by potential impact using data-driven insights.
- **Modularization.** Crowdsource fairly-remunerated ideas to break problems into modules with clear APIs. Modules are interchangeable based off their exposed functions and dependencies. Think of these as automatically-priced micro-SaaS that can be instantiated as part of larger solutions. An innovator can think in terms of "if this module existed" to delegate the implementation.
- **Attribution.** Measure each contributor‚Äôs impact with precise, quantitative metrics.
- **Incentives.** Reward participants transparently for every module they build.
- **Professional Network.** Leverage a database of 700 million experts and integrated outreach tools to connect the right specialists when problems arise.
- **Public-private mix** 	Publish only the touchpoints; proprietary plugins stay private until runtime, giving you crowdsourced quality on the surface and IP protection underneath.

With these building blocks, we layer fair attribution and incentives atop familiar tooling to create a truly equitable innovation ecosystem.
By minimizing adoption friction and ensuring fair reward, we foster a permissionless ecosystem where anyone can contribute or consume modules seamlessly.

OpenSpur is a constellation of OpenSpur modules - we play by the same rules. 
Improve and swap any modules OpenSpur is comprised of and get a percentage of every transaction. 

This repository will serve as the entry point for the OpenSpur ecosystem of modules. We will shortly publish the energy measure of this text.

### 4 ¬∑ Pilot Use Cases

### 5 ¬∑ Technical Architecture

- **Custom Tendermint chain** for cryptographic payment guarantees.  
- **Burn-and-mint gateways** (BTC‚ÜíSPUR on Osmosis; ETH‚ÜíSPUR live on Uniswap).  
- **Software cartridges** ‚Äì prepaid binaries that expire by date or execution count; blockchain enforces build and payout.  
- **ACE module** ‚Äì measures energy delta for every module.  
- **CI plugins** ‚Äì GitHub Actions & Jenkins produce cartridges with signed hashes.  
- **Ecosystem tools** ‚Äì register plugins, discover experts, email invites, browse opportunities.

### 7 ¬∑ Tokenomics

**SPUR tokens capture real ecosystem value through direct problem-solving impact.** Genuine token utility: the more problems OpenSpur solves, the more value flows to SPUR holders. Unlike speculative tokens, SPUR derives worth from measurable real-world improvements‚Äîenergy savings, bandwidth reductions, quantum breakthroughs, and infrastructure optimizations that generate billions in verified economic value.

Buying software from us is a no-brainer: we only charge 15% of the value generated. Cryptographic guarantees are in place - no software cartridge can be built without the blockchain's go-ahead, which in turn comes from the contributors. Thus, deploying software built with OpenSpur means you need SPUR tokens to pay for the build.

The token allocation is as follows:

100 million tokens on the burn and mint Ethereum contract
100 million tokens on the Tendermint blockchain

We will be releasing 100 million tokens via burn and mint mechanics on BNB and Solana. 

### 8 ¬∑ Allocations

18% to founding team, out of which
4% will be automatically converted to cash for runway when project hits 1 billion in market cap.

82% will be freely traded.

We will apply the same ACE measure to dependencies - even if they are open source, but only if the authors register in the repository.

### Next¬†Steps

We‚Äôre finalising tests and preparing for launch:

1. Kernel pilot rollout. Engage invited maintainers; measure real‚Äëworld energy deltas using RAPL counters and fleet‚Äëwide telemetry.
2. Tweet your project proposal with #openspur‚Äîwe‚Äôll retweet it automatically, reaching a larger audience. If implemented, you will get 15% of the generated value, perpetually.
3. Community. ‚≠ê Star the repo and help build the future of fair innovation.
