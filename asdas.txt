### The OpenSpur Solution: Attribution Layer for Innovation

1. **Define & Quantify Components.** Recursively decompose ideas into modular proposals—identify each component in a solution and assign measurable values to prepare for implementation.  
2. **Modular Architecture.** Build interoperable plugins with clear APIs—any language, existing build tools supported.  
3. **Energy Density Scoring.** Score modules by the effort saved or value created.  
4. **Automated Pricing & Billing.** Derive price tags from energy density; users pay per module via a unified credit system, eliminating the need for separate subscriptions for each component—unlike tools such as n8n that interconnect Slack, Gmail, and Calendly but require distinct paid accounts. OpenSpur modules interoperate seamlessly, building a living ecosystem of innovation.  
5. **Instant Remuneration.** Distribute revenue immediately to contributors proportional to their module’s score.  
6. **Professional Network.** Maintain a database of 700 million professionals and integrated communication tools to alert and engage the right experts when new problems or modules need their skills.
